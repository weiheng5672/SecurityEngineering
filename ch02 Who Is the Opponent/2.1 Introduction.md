Ideologues may deal with the world as they would wish it to be, but engineers deal with the world as it is. If you’re going to defend systems against attack, you first need to know who your enemies are.

In the early days of computing, we mostly didn’t have real enemies; while banks and the military had to protect their systems, most other people didn’t really bother. 
The first computer systems were isolated, serving a single company or university. 
Students might try to hack the system to get more resources and sysadmins would try to stop them, but it was mostly a game.
When dial-up connections started to appear, pranksters occasionally guessed passwords and left joke messages, as they’d done at university. 
The early Internet was a friendly place, inhabited by academics, engineers at tech companies, and a few hobbyists. 
We knew that malware was possible but almost nobody took it seriously until the late 1980s when PC viruses appeared, followed by the Internet worm in 1988. (Even that was a student experiment that escaped from the lab; I tell the story in section 21.3.2.)

Things changed once everyone started to get online. The mid-1990s saw the first spam, the late 1990s brought the first distributed denial-of-service attack, and the explosion of mail-order business in the dotcom boom introduced credit card fraud. 
To begin with, online fraud was a cottage industry; the same person would steal credit card numbers and use them to buy goods which he’d then sell, or make up forged cards to use in a store. 
Things changed in the mid-2000s with the emergence of underground markets. 
These let the bad guys specialise – one gang could write malware, another could harvest bank credentials, and yet others could devise ways of cashing out. 
This enabled them to get good at their jobs, to scale up and to globalise, just as manufacturing did in the late eighteenth century. 
The 2000s also saw the world’s governments putting in the effort to ‘Master the Internet’ (as the NSA put it) – working out how to collect data at scale and index it, just as Google does, to make it available to analysts. 
It also saw the emergence of social networks, so that everyone could have a home online – not just geeks with the skills to create their own hand-crafted web pages. And of course, once everyone is online, that includes not just spies and crooks but also jerks, creeps, racists and bullies.

Over the past decade, this threat landscape has stabilised. We also know quite
a lot about it. 
Thanks to Ed Snowden and other whistleblowers, we know a lot about the capabilities and methods of Western intelligence services; we’ve also learned a lot about China, Russia and other nation-state threat actors. 
We know a lot about cybercrime; online crime now makes up about half of all crime, by volume and by value. 
There’s a substantial criminal infrastructure based on malware and botnets with which we are constantly struggling; there’s also a large ecosystem of scams. 
Many traditional crimes have gone online, and a typical firm has to worry not just about external fraudsters but also about dis-honest insiders. 
Some firms have to worry about hostile governments, some about other firms, and some about activists. 
Many people have to deal with online hostility, from kids suffering cyber-bullying at school through harassment of elected politicians to people who are stalked by former partners. 
And our politics may become more polarised because of the dynamics of online extremism.

One of the first things the security engineer needs to do when tackling a new problem is to identify the likely opponents. 
Although you can design some specific system components (such as cryptography) to resist all reasonable adversaries, the same is much less true for a complex real-world system.
You can’t protect it against all possible threats and still expect it to do useful work at a reasonable cost. 
So what sort of capabilities will the adversaries have, and what motivation? How certain are you of this assessment, and how might it change over the system’s lifetime? 
In this chapter I will classify online and electronic threats depending on motive. 
First, I’ll discuss surveillance, intrusion and manipulation done by governments for reasons of state, ranging from cyber-intelligence to cyber-conflict operations. 
Second, I’ll deal with criminals whose motive is mainly money. 
Third will be researchers who find vulnerabilities for fun or for money, or who report them out of social conscience – compelling firms to patch their software and clean up their operations. 
Finally, I’ll discuss bad actors whose reasons are personal and who mainly commit crimes against the person, from cyber-bullies to stalkers.

The big service firms, such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook, have to worry about all four classes of threat. 
Most firms and most private individuals will only be concerned with some of them. 
But it’s important for a security engineer to understand the big picture so you can help clients work out what their own threat model should be, and what sort of attacks they should plan to forestall.

這段文字闡述了網絡安全領域的歷史、威脅模式和安全工程師在保護系統時的思考框架，以下是逐段的解釋：  

---

1. **理想主義者 vs. 工程師**：  
   理想主義者傾向於從理想的角度看待世界，而工程師必須面對現實。因此，要有效保護系統，首先需要了解潛在的敵人。

2. **早期電腦時代**：  
   起初，除了銀行和軍方，幾乎沒有人擔心網絡安全。電腦系統通常是孤立的，黑客行為更多是學生為了獲取資源和系統管理員之間的遊戲。

3. **早期互聯網環境**：  
   隨著撥號連接的出現，惡作劇者會嘗試猜測密碼，但仍然是玩笑居多。直到 1980 年代末期，個人電腦病毒和 1988 年的互聯網蠕蟲出現，才真正引起了人們對惡意軟件的關注。

4. **威脅模式的演變**：  
   1990 年代中期開始出現垃圾郵件，隨後是分佈式拒絕服務攻擊（DDoS）和信用卡詐騙。  
   到 2000 年代，黑市使得黑客活動專業化和規模化，類似於工業革命時的製造業發展。  
   這時，各國政府也投入資源來掌握互聯網監控技術。

5. **社交網絡的影響**：  
   社交網絡普及使得所有人都能擁有線上身份，但同時也引來各種不良行為者，包括間諜、騙子、種族主義者和霸凌者。

6. **現代威脅環境**：  
   當今的威脅已經穩定，主要分為國家級攻擊、金融犯罪、道德或商業漏洞研究者，以及出於個人動機的惡意行為者。  
   網絡犯罪如今占據了所有犯罪行為的大半壁江山，涉及惡意軟件、殭屍網絡以及各類詐騙。

7. **安全工程師的策略**：  
   安全工程師需要識別敵對行為者的能力和動機。不能假設能對抗所有威脅而同時維持合理成本和效能，因此必須根據具體系統的威脅模型來制定防禦措施。

8. **威脅的四大類別**：  
   - 國家監控和網絡戰爭  
   - 以金錢為目的的犯罪  
   - 發現漏洞的研究者  
   - 個人動機的惡意行為者（如霸凌者和跟蹤狂）

---

**總結**：  
這篇文章強調了了解敵人和風險的重要性，並引導安全專家根據現實威脅建立針對性策略。對於大企業和個人，理解整體風險態勢有助於更好地設計和保護系統。
