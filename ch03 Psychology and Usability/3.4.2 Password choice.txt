Many accounts are compromised by guessing PINs or passwords. 
許多帳戶被猜測PIN碼或密碼而受到破壞。

There are botnets constantly breaking into online accounts by guessing passwords and password-recovery questions
, as I described in 2.3.1.4, in order to use email accounts to send spam and to recruit machines to botnets. 
And as people invent new services and put passwords on them
, the password guessers find new targets. 
有許多僵屍網絡不斷地通過猜測密碼和密碼恢復問題來入侵在線帳戶，
如我在2.3.1.4中所描述的那樣，目的是利用電子郵件帳戶發送垃圾郵件並招募機器加入僵屍網絡。
隨著人們發明新的服務並對其設置密碼，
密碼猜測者找到了新的目標。

A recent example is cryptocurrency wallets: 
an anonymous ‘bitcoin bandit’ managed to steal $50m by trying lots of weak passwords for ethereum wallets [810]. 
最近的一個例子是加密貨幣錢包：
一位匿名的「比特幣強盜」成功地通過嘗試許多弱密碼來竊取了5000萬美元的以太幣錢包[810]。

Meanwhile, billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency has been lost because passwords were forgotten. 
與此同時，價值數十億美元的加密貨幣因為忘記密碼而遺失。

So passwords matter
, and there are basically three broad concerns
, in ascending order of importance and difficulty:
因此，密碼很重要，
基本上有三個廣泛的問題，
按重要性和難度遞增排序：

1. Will the user enter the password correctly with a high enough probability?
2. Will the user remember the password, or will they have to either write it down or choose one that’s easy for the attacker to guess?
3. Will the user break the system security by disclosing the password to a third party, whether accidentally, on purpose, or as a result of deception?

用戶是否有足夠高的概率輸入正確的密碼？
用戶是否會記住密碼，還是他們將不得不將其寫下來或選擇一個易於攻擊者猜測的密碼？
用戶是否會因為意外地、故意地或被欺騙而將密碼洩露給第三方，從而破壞系統安全性？
