Our second psychological issue is that people often find passwords hard to remember [2079]. 

Twelve to twenty digits may be easy to copy from a telegram or a meter ticket
, but when customers are expected to memorize passwords
, they either choose values that are easy for attackers to guess, or write them down, or both.

In fact, standard password advice has been summed up as:
“Choose a password you can’t remember, and don’t write it down”.
The problems are not limited to computer access. 
For example, one chain of cheap hotels in France introduced self service. 
You’d turn up at the hotel, swipe your credit card in the reception machine
, and get a receipt with a numerical access code to unlock your room door. 

To keep costs down, the rooms did not have en-suite bathrooms. 
A common failure mode was that 
you’d get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom
, forget your access code
, and realise you hadn’t taken the receipt with you. 

So you’d have to sleep on the bathroom floor until the staff arrived the following morning.
Password memorability can be discussed under five main headings: 
naïve choice
, user abilities and training
, design errors
, operational failures 
and vulnerability 
to social-engineering attacks.

我們第二個心理問題是人們常常覺得很難記住密碼。

十二到二十個數字可能從電報或計費票據複製起來很容易，
但當客戶需要記住密碼時，他們要么選擇易於攻擊者猜測的值，要么將其寫下來，要么兩者兼而有之。

事實上，標準的密碼建議被總結為：
“選擇一個你無法記住的密碼，並且不要將其寫下來”。

問題不僅限於電腦訪問。
例如，法國某連鎖廉價酒店引入了自助服務。
你會來到酒店，將信用卡在接待機上滑動，
然後收到一張含有解鎖房門的數字存取代碼的收據。

為了控制成本，房間沒有連接浴室。
一個常見的故障模式是，你半夜起來去洗手間，忘記了你的存取代碼，意識到你沒有帶收據。
所以你得在浴室地板上睡到隔天早上員工到達為止。

密碼易記性可以在五個主要方面進行討論：
天真的選擇、用戶能力和培訓、設計錯誤、操作失敗和容易受社會工程攻擊的漏洞。
