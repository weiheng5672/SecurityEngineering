Many real attacks exploit psychology at least as much as technology. 
We saw in the last chapter how some online crimes involve the manipulation of angry mobs, while both property crimes and espionage make heavy use of phishing, in which victims are lured by an email to log on to a website that appears genuine but that's actually designed to steal their passwords or get them to install malware.

Online frauds like phishing are often easier to do, and harder to stop, than similar real-world frauds because many online protection mechanisms are neither as easy to use nor as difficult to forge as their real-world equivalents. 
It's much easier for crooks to create a bogus bank website that passes casual inspection than to build an actual bogus bank branch in a shopping street.

We've evolved social and psychological tools over millions of years to help us deal with deception in face-to-face contexts, but these are less effective when we get an email that asks us to do something.
For an ideal technology, good use would be easier than bad use.
We have many examples in the physical world: a potato peeler is easier to use for peeling potatoes than a knife is, but a lot harder to use for murder.
But we've not always got this right for computer systems yet.
Much of the asymmetry between good and bad on which we rely in our daily business doesn't just depend on formal exchanges - which can be automated easily - but on some combination of physical objects, judgment of people, and the supporting social protocols. 
So, as our relationships with employers, banks and government become more formalised via online communication, and we lose both physical and human context, the forgery of these communications becomes more of a risk.

Deception, of various kinds, is now the principal mechanism used to defeat online security. 
It can be used to get passwords, to compromise confidential information or to manipulate financial transactions directly.
Hoaxes and frauds have always happened, but the Internet makes some of them easier, and lets others be repackaged in ways that may bypass our existing controls (be they personal intuitions, company procedures or even laws).

Another driver for the surge in attacks based on social engineering is that people are getting better at technology.
As designers learn how to forestall the easier technical attacks, psychological manipulation of system users or operators becomes ever more attractive. 
So the security engineer absolutely must understand basic psychology, as a prerequisite for dealing competently with everything from passwords to CAPTCHAs and from phishing to social engineering in general; a working appreciation of risk misperception and scaremongering is also necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying angry online mobs and the societal response to emergencies from terrorism to pandemic disease. 
So just as research in security economics led to a real shift in perspective between the first and second editions of this book, research in security psychology has made much of the difference to how we view the world between the second edition and this one.

In the rest of this chapter, I’ll first survey relevant research in psychology, then work through how we apply the principles to make password authentication mechanisms more robust against attack, to security usability more generally, and beyond that to good design.

這段文字主要討論網路安全中的心理學因素，以及社交工程（social engineering）在網路攻擊中的重要性。以下是逐步解釋：

### 1. **心理學與技術結合的攻擊**  
很多網路犯罪不僅依賴技術漏洞，也大量利用心理學手段。例如：  
- **憤怒群體的操控**：攻擊者煽動網路上的憤怒群體來散佈虛假資訊。  
- **網路釣魚（Phishing）**：透過欺騙性的電子郵件引誘受害者點擊連結並輸入密碼，或下載惡意軟體。  

### 2. **網路詐騙比現實詐騙更難防範**  
網路詐騙之所以更容易進行且難以阻止，是因為：  
- 網路保護機制的使用往往不如真實世界中的防護手段直觀或安全。  
- 建立虛假的銀行網站比建造一個假銀行分行容易得多。  

### 3. **人類進化中的心理防禦在網路世界中失效**  
人類在面對面交流時，透過長期進化發展了識破欺騙的心理工具。然而，這些工具在處理電子郵件請求時效果較差，因為缺乏社會和物理線索。  

### 4. **良好的技術應更容易用於正確用途**  
理想的技術設計應讓「正當使用」比「惡意使用」更容易。  
- 例子：馬鈴薯削皮器比刀更適合削馬鈴薯，但用來傷人卻比刀難。  
- 許多網路系統尚未達到這種非對稱性，導致欺騙更容易成功。  

### 5. **網路溝通的正式化增加了風險**  
隨著人們越來越依賴網路來與銀行、政府和雇主交流，這些溝通失去了面對面的物理和人情背景，使假造或偽造的風險變高。  

### 6. **欺騙成為擊敗網路安全的主要手段**  
網路詐騙和騙局一直存在，但網路讓這些詐騙變得更容易，並以更具創新方式繞過現有的控制措施。  

### 7. **為何社交工程攻擊增加**  
隨著技術人員改善技術漏洞的防禦手段，攻擊者更加偏向於心理操控（即社交工程）來達到目的。

### 8. **安全工程師必須了解心理學**  
有效的安全工程師需要掌握基礎心理學，以處理從密碼到CAPTCHA，以及從釣魚到更廣泛的社交工程攻擊。他們還需理解風險感知錯誤與恐慌操縱，來預測網路行為模式和社會對災難的反應。

### 9. **研究進步的影響**  
安全經濟學和安全心理學的研究，讓我們對安全議題的理解與解法大幅進步。後續章節將探討如何運用這些原則提升密碼認證、使用性和設計品質。

總結來說，這段文字強調心理學在網路安全中的關鍵作用，並點出良好設計應讓「正確使用」比「錯誤使用」更容易，以減少詐騙風險。
