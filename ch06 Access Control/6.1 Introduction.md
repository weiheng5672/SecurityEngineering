I first learned to program on an IBM mainframe whose input was punched cards and whose output was a printer.
You queued up with a deck of cards, ran the job, and went away with printout.
All security was physical.
Then along came machines that would run more than one program at once, and the protection problem of preventing one program from interfering with another.
You don't want a virus to steal the passwords from your browser, or patch a banking application so as to steal your money. 
And many reliability problems stem from applications misunderstanding each other, or fighting with each other.
But it's tricky to separate applications when the customer wants them to share data. 
It would make phishing much harder if your email client and browser ran on separate machines, so you were unable to just click on URLs in emails, but that would make life too hard.

From the 1970s, access control became the centre of gravity of computer security.
It's where security engineering meets computer science.
Its function is to control which principals (persons, processes, machines, ...) have access to which resources in the system - which files they can read, which programs they can execute, how they share data with other principals, and so on.

It's become horrendously complex. 
If you start out by leafing through the 7000-plus pages of Arm's architecture reference manual or the equally complex arrangements for Windows, your first reaction might be "I wish I'd studied music instead!" 
In this chapter I try to help you make sense of it all.

Access control works at a number of different levels, including at least:

1. Access controls at the application level may express a very rich, domain-specific security policy. 
The call centre staff in a bank are typically not allowed to see your account details until you have answered a couple of security questions; this not only stops outsiders impersonating you, but also stops the bank staff looking up the accounts of celebrities, or their neighbours. 
Some transactions might also require approval from a supervisor. 
And that's nothing compared with the complexity of the access controls on a modern social networking site, which will have a thicket of rules about who can see, copy, and search what data from whom, and privacy options that users can set to modify these rules.


2. The applications may be written on top of middleware, such as a web browser, a bank's bookkeeping system or a social network's database management system. 
These enforce a number of protection properties. 
For example, bookkeeping systems ensure that a transaction that debits one account must credit another, with the debits and credits balancing so that money cannot be created or destroyed; they must also allow the system's state to be reconstructed later.

3. As the operating system constructs resources such as files and communications ports from lower level components, it has to provide ways to control access to them. 
Your Android phone treats apps written by different companies as different users and protects their data from each other. 
The same happens when a shared server separates theVMs, containers or other resources belonging to different users.

4. Finally, the operating system relies on the processor and its associated memory-management hardware, which control which memory addresses a given process or thread can access.

As we work up from the hardware through the operating system and middleware to the application layer, the controls become progressively more complex and less reliable. 
And we find the same access-control functions being implemented at multiple layers. 
For example, the separation between different phone apps that is provided by Android is mirrored in your browser which separates web page material according to the domain name it came from (though this separation is often less thorough).
And the access controls built at the application layer or the middleware layer may largely duplicate access controls in the underlying operating system or hardware. 
It can get very messy, and to make sense of it we need to understand the underlying principles, the common architectures, and how they have evolved.

I will start off by discussing operating-system protection mechanisms that support the isolation of multiple processes. 
These came first historically – being invented along with the first time-sharing systems in the 1960s – and they remain the foundation on which many higher-layer mechanisms are built, as well as inspiring similar mechanisms at higher layers. 
They are often described as discretionary access control (DAC) mechanisms, which leave protection to the machine operator, or mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms which are typically under the control of the vendor and protect the operating system itself from being modified by malware.
I’ll give an introduction to software attacks and techniques for defending against them – MAC, ASLR, sandboxing, virtualisation and what can be done with hardware. 
Modern hardware not only provides CPU support for virtualisation and capabilities, but also hardware support such as TPM chips for trusted boot to stop malware being persistent. 
These help us tackle the toxic legacy of the old single-user PC operating systems such as DOS and Win95/98 which let any process modify any data, and constrain the many applications that won’t run unless you trick them into thinking that they are running with administrator privileges.

這段話講述了計算機安全性和訪問控制的歷史發展，特別是在操作系統中的多重保護機制：

最初的電腦系統，如IBM主機，依賴於打孔卡進行輸入，並通過打印機輸出結果，當時的安全性是以物理方式實現的。隨著時間的推移，計算機系統開始能夠同時運行多個程序，這也帶來了保護問題，即如何防止不同程序互相干擾，從而保護系統免受病毒或不當程序的影響。這些問題要求必須控制哪些用戶或進程可以訪問哪些資源（如文件、應用程序等）。

在1970年代，訪問控制成為計算機安全的核心，涉及哪些“實體”可以訪問哪些資源（例如，誰可以讀取哪些文件或執行哪些程序）。訪問控制變得非常複雜，尤其是在不同的層級（應用層、操作系統層、硬件層）中，都需要進行控制。

1. **應用層的訪問控制**：例如，銀行的呼叫中心員工在未經核實安全問題之前，無法查看客戶的帳戶信息，這樣可以防止內部員工未經授權地訪問或篡改資料。
   
2. **中間件層的保護**：例如，銀行的記帳系統會確保一筆交易的借方和貸方平衡，並且系統的狀態可以在事後重建。

3. **操作系統層的訪問控制**：例如，Android操作系統將不同應用程序視為不同的用戶，並且保護它們之間的數據不會相互干擾。

4. **硬件層的訪問控制**：處理器及其內存管理硬件控制著不同進程或線程可以訪問哪些內存地址。

這些不同層級的控制可以重疊，並且可能會出現複雜的情況。例如，Android的應用程序隔離機制與瀏覽器中基於域名的頁面隔離機制相似，但後者的隔離可能較為簡單。這種複雜性要求理解底層原則、常見架構及其演變過程。

此外，操作系統保護機制，支援多個進程的隔離，這些機制自1960年代的首次時間共享系統以來就存在，並成為許多高層機制的基礎。
“自願訪問控制”（DAC）和“強制訪問控制”（MAC）是兩種主要的訪問控制模式。DAC由機器操作員控制，MAC則通常由系統供應商控制，並保護操作系統本身免受惡意軟件的修改。

現代硬件提供了支持虛擬化和能力控制的CPU，以及用於信任啟動的TPM芯片，以防止惡意軟件的持久性。這些技術幫助我們處理舊式PC操作系統（如DOS和Windows 95/98）所遺留下的問題，其中的進程可以隨意修改數據，並且很多應用程序只有在假裝自己以管理員權限運行時才會正常工作。

總結來說，這篇文章探討了從硬件到操作系統，再到中間件和應用層的訪問控制，並介紹了這些控制如何協同工作以保護現代計算機系統的安全性。
