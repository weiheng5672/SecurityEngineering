Passwords are just one example of a more general concept, the security protocol.
If security engineering has a core theme, it may be the study of security protocols.
They specify the steps that principals use to establish trust relationships.
They are where the cryptography and the access controls meet;they are the tools we use to link up human users with remote machines, to synchronise security contexts, and to regulate key applications such as payment. 
We've come across a few protocols already, including challenge-response authentication and Kerberos. 
In this chapter, I'll dig down into the details, and give many examples of how protocols fail.

A typical security system consists of a number of principals such as people, companies, phones, computers and card readers, which communicate using a variety of channels including fibre, wifi, the cellular network, bluetooth, infrared, and by carrying data on physical devices such as bank cards and transport tickets.
The security protocols are the rules that govern these communications. 
They are designed so that the system will survive malicious acts such as people telling lies on the phone, hostile governments jamming radio, or forgers altering the data on train tickets. 
Protection against all possible attacks is often too expensive, so protocol designs make assumptions about threats.
For example, when we get a user to log on by entering a password into a machine, we implicitly assume that she can enter it into the right machine.
In the old days of hard-wired terminals in the workplace, this was reasonable; now that people log on to websites over the Internet, it is much less obvious.
Evaluating a protocol thus involves two questions: first, is the threat model realistic? 
Second, does the protocol deal with it?

Protocols may be very simple, such as swiping a badge through a reader to enter a building. 
They often involve interaction, and are not necessarily technical. 
For example, when we order a bottle of fine wine in a restaurant, the standard protocol is that the wine waiter offers us the menu (so that we see the prices but our guests don't); they bring the bottle, so we can check the label,the seal and the temperature; they open it so we can taste it; and then serve it.
This has evolved to provide some privacy (our guests don't learn the price), some integrity (we can be sure we got the right bottle and that it wasn't refilled with cheap plonk) and non-repudiation (we can't complain afterwards that the wine was off). 
Matt Blaze gives other non-technical protocol examples from ticket inspection, aviation security and voting in [261]. 
Traditional protocols like these often evolved over decades or centuries to meet social expectations as well as technical threats.

At the technical end of things, protocols get a lot more complex, and they don't always get better. 
As the car industry moved from metal keys to electronic keys with buttons you press, theft fell, since the new keys were harder to copy.
But the move to keyless entry has seen car crime rise again, as the bad guys figured out how to build relay devices that would make a key seem closer to the car than it actually was. 
Another security upgrade that's turned out to be tricky is the move from magnetic-strip cards to smartcards. 
Europe made this move in the late 2000s while the USA is only catching up in the late 2010s.
Fraud against cards issued in Europe actually went up for several years; clones of European cards were used in magnetic-strip cash machines in the USA, as the two systems' protection mechanisms didn't quite mesh. 
And there was a protocol failure that let a thief use a stolen chipcard in a store even if he didn't know the PIN, which took the banks several years to fix.

So we need to look systematically at security protocols and how they fail.

這段文字探討了**安全協議（security protocols）**的重要性及其在安全工程中的核心角色。安全協議是用來管理各種系統中不同角色（人、設備、公司等）之間的溝通規則，其目的在於保護系統免受各種惡意行為的威脅，如竊聽、欺詐或訊息篡改。

### 核心觀點解釋
1. **安全協議的定義**  
   安全協議規範了在安全系統中各方如何溝通、建立信任和保護數據。它們整合了加密技術和存取控制，讓人類用戶能夠安全地與遠端設備互動，或管理支付等應用。

2. **威脅模型與協議評估**  
   設計安全協議時，工程師會基於假設的威脅模型進行設計，因為完全防禦所有可能的攻擊往往成本過高。協議評估涉及兩個問題：
   - **威脅模型是否現實？**  
     例如，要求用戶輸入密碼時，假設用戶能夠識別並選擇正確的設備，但這在網路登入中可能並不安全。
   - **協議能否應對該模型中的威脅？**  
     協議的實際運作是否能提供預期的保護。

3. **非技術性協議的例子**  
   - **餐廳點酒的過程**  
     這是一個非技術性的安全協議例子，保護隱私（客人看不到價格）、完整性（確認酒的品質）以及不可否認性（客人無法否認選擇的酒）。
   - **其他傳統協議**  
     例如，票務檢查和航空安檢等，這些協議經過了長時間的社會和技術演化來應對威脅。

4. **技術性協議的進步與挑戰**  
   隨著技術進步，新的協議可能導致意想不到的安全問題：
   - **汽車無鑰匙進入系統的風險**  
     儘管電子按鍵提升了安全性，但無鑰匙技術被壞人利用中繼設備欺騙車輛，導致犯罪增多。
   - **智能卡系統的轉換問題**  
     歐洲採用智慧卡技術後，詐騙活動一度增加，因為不同地區系統的安全機制未能協同運作。還有協議漏洞讓小偷即使不知道密碼也能使用被盜卡片。

### 總結
這段文字強調了安全協議是安全系統中至關重要的一部分，並且要有效保護系統，設計協議時必須現實地考慮威脅，並確保協議能處理這些威脅。從非技術性場景到複雜技術協議的失敗案例，這些都提醒我們需要系統化地審視協議的設計與實施。
