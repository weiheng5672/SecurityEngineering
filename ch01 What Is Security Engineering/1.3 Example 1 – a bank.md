Banks operate a lot of security-critical computer systems.

1. A bank’s operations rest on a core bookkeeping system. 
This keeps customer account master files plus a number of journals that record incoming and outgoing transactions. The main threat here is the bank’s own staff; about one percent of bank branch staff are fired each year, mostly for petty dishonesty (the average theft is only a few thousand dollars). 
The traditional defence comes from book-keeping procedures that have evolved over centuries. 
For example, each debit against one account must be matched by a credit against another; so money can only be moved within a bank, never created or destroyed. In addition, large transfers typically need two people to authorize them. 
There are also alarms that look for unusual volumes or patterns of transactions, and staff are required to take regular vacations with no access to the bank’s systems.

2. One public face is the bank’s automatic teller machines. Authenticating transactions based on a customer’s card and personal identification number – so as to defend against both outside and inside attack – is harder than it looks! 
There have been many epi-demics of ‘phantom withdrawals’ in various countries when local villains (or bank staff) have found and exploited loopholes in the system. 
Automatic teller machines are also interesting as they were the first large-scale commercial use of cryptography, and they helped establish a number of crypto standards. 
The mechanisms developed for ATMs have been extended to point-of-sale terminals in shops, where card payments have largely displaced cash; and they’ve been adapted for other applications such as prepayment utility meters.

3. Another public face is the bank’s website and mobile phone app. 
Most customers now do their routine business, such as bill payments and transfers between savings and checking accounts, online rather than at a branch. 
Bank websites have come under heavy attack since 2005 from phishing – where customers are invited to enter their passwords at bogus websites. 
The standard security mechanisms designed in the 1990s turned out to be less effective once criminals started attacking the customers rather than the bank, so many banks now send you a text message with an authentication code. 
The crooks’ reaction is to go to a phone shop, pretend to be you, and buy a new phone that takes over your phone number. 
This arms race poses many fascinating security engineering problems mixing elements from authentication, usability, psychology, operations and economics.

4. Behind the scenes are high-value messaging systems, used to move large sums between banks; to trade in securities; to issue letters of credit and guarantees; and so on. 
An attack on such a system is the dream of the high-tech criminal – and we hear that the government of North Korea has stolen many millions by attacks on banks. 
The defence is a mixture of bookkeeping controls, access controls, and cryptography.

5. The bank’s branches may seem large, solid and prosperous, reassuring
customers that their money is safe. But the stone facade is theatre rather
than reality. 
If you walk in with a gun, the tellers will give you all the cash you can see; and if you break in at night, you can cut into the safe in minutes with an abrasive wheel. 
The effective controls center on alarm systems, which are connected to a security company’s control center,whose staff check things out by video and call the police if they have to.
Cryptography is used to prevent a robber manipulating the communi-cations and making the alarm appear to say ‘all’s well’ when it isn’t.
I’ll look at these applications in later chapters. 
Banking computer security is important: until the early 2000s, banks were the main civilian market for many computer security products, so they had a huge influence on security standards.

這段文字介紹了銀行在不同層面上使用的安全關鍵系統，從核心業務到公開界面，再到幕後操作，探討了銀行面臨的威脅以及應對措施。以下是逐段解釋：

---

### **1. 核心帳務系統：**

- **功能：**  
  銀行的核心帳務系統負責管理客戶賬戶和交易記錄，確保每筆借方（扣款）與貸方（存款）匹配。這樣可以防止資金被無中生有地「創造」或「消失」。

- **威脅：**  
  - **內部威脅：** 每年約有1%的銀行分行員工因小額盜竊被解僱，平均涉案金額為數千美元。  
  - **應對措施：**  
    - 傳統記賬程序（例如雙方核對機制）。  
    - 大額交易需兩人授權。  
    - 安裝異常交易模式警報系統。  
    - 強制員工定期休假，以防止持續性不當行為。

---

### **2. 自動提款機 (ATM)：**

- **功能：**  
  ATM是銀行面向公眾的界面之一，基於客戶的卡片和PIN碼進行身份驗證。

- **挑戰：**  
  - 防範內部和外部攻擊。  
  - 曾發生多次「幽靈取款」事件，即犯罪分子利用系統漏洞非法提取現金。

- **意義：**  
  ATM是第一個大規模商業應用密碼學的系統，促成了多項加密標準的誕生，其機制被擴展到POS終端和預付費系統等其他應用。

---

### **3. 網站和手機應用：**

- **功能：**  
  客戶現在主要通過在線銀行進行日常交易，如支付賬單和賬戶間轉賬。

- **威脅：**  
  - **釣魚攻擊：** 客戶被誘導在假網站輸入密碼。  
  - **SIM卡交換攻擊：** 犯罪分子冒充客戶獲取新SIM卡，接管電話號碼，攔截短信驗證碼。

- **挑戰：**  
  這是一場涉及身份驗證、可用性、心理學、操作和經濟學的攻防軍備競賽。

---

### **4. 高價值消息系統：**

- **功能：**  
  用於銀行間的大額資金轉移、證券交易、信用證發行等。

- **威脅：**  
  - 高技術犯罪者的夢想目標，例如朝鮮政府據傳通過此類攻擊盜取了數百萬美元。

- **應對措施：**  
  結合記賬控制、訪問控制和加密技術。

---

### **5. 分行物理安全：**

- **功能：**  
  分行的大理石立面和穩重形象是給客戶的一種心理保障，但實際物理安全性有限。

- **威脅與應對：**  
  - **搶劫：** 若持槍搶劫，出納員會交出所有現金。  
  - **夜間入侵：** 使用磨輪可在數分鐘內切開保險箱。  
  - **核心控制：** 依賴報警系統，通過視頻監控和密碼技術防止報警信號被篡改。

---

### **6. 銀行對安全標準的影響：**

- **歷史意義：**  
  直到2000年代初期，銀行是計算機安全產品的主要民用市場，對安全標準的制定有重大影響。

---

### **總結：**

銀行的安全系統涵蓋多個層面，包括核心系統、客戶界面和物理安全，每個層面都有獨特的威脅和防禦方法。  
這段文字不僅說明了銀行安全的重要性，還展示了安全工程如何結合歷史經驗、技術創新和實踐應用來應對複雜的挑戰。
