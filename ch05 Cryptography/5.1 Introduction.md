Cryptography is where security engineering meets mathematics. 
It gives us the tools that underlie most modern security protocols. 
It is the key technology for protecting distributed systems, yet it is surprisingly hard to do right. 
As we've already seen in Chapter 4, "Protocols," cryptography has often been used to protect the wrong things, or to protect them in the wrong way. Unfortunately, the available crypto tools aren't always very usable.

But no security engineer can ignore cryptology. A medical friend once told me that while she was young, she worked overseas in a country where, for economic reasons, they'd shortened their medical degrees and concentrated on producing specialists as quickly as possible. 
One day, a patient who'd had both kidneys removed and was awaiting a transplant needed her dialysis shunt redone. 
The surgeon sent the patient back from the theater on the grounds that there was no urinalysis on file. 
It just didn't occur to him that a patient with no kidneys couldn't produce any urine.

Just as a doctor needs to understand physiology as well as surgery, so a security engineer needs to be familiar with at least the basics of crypto(and much else). 
There are, broadly speaking, three levels at which one can approach crypto. 
The first consists of the underlying intuitions; the second of the mathematics that we use to clarify these intuitions, provide security proofs where possible and tidy up the constructions that cause the most confusion; and the third is the cryptographic engineering - the tools we commonly use, and the experience of what can go wrong with them.
In this chapter, I assume you have no training in crypto and set out to explain the basic intuitions.
I illustrate them with engineering, and sketch enough of the mathematics to help give you access to the literature when you need it. 
One reason you need some crypto know-how is that many common constructions are confusing, and many tools offer unsafe defaults.
For example, Microsoft's Crypto API (CAPI) nudges engineers to use electronic codebook mode; by the end of this chapter you should understand what that is, why it's bad, and what you should do instead.

Many crypto textbooks assume that their readers are pure maths graduates, so let me start off with non-mathematical definitions.
Cryptography refers to the science and art of designing ciphers; cryptanalysis to the science and art of breaking them; while cryptology, often shortened to just crypto, is the study of both.
The input to an encryption process is commonly called the plaintext or cleartext, and the output the ciphertext. 
Thereafter, things get somewhat more complicated. 
There are a number of basic building blocks, such as block ciphers, stream ciphers, and hash functions. 
Block ciphers may either have one key for both encryption and decryption, in which case they're called shared-key (also secret-key or symmetric), or have separate keys for encryption and decryption, in which case they're called public-key or asymmetric. 
A digital signature scheme is a special type of asymmetric crypto primitive.

I will first give some historical examples to illustrate the basic concepts. 
I'll then fine-tune definitions by introducing the security models that cryptologists use, including perfect secrecy, concrete security, indistinguishability and the random oracle model.
Finally, I'll show how the more important cryptographic algorithms actually work, and how they can be used to protect data. 
En route, I'll give examples of how people broke weak ciphers, and weak constructions using strong ciphers.

這段文字探討了**密碼學 (Cryptography)** 與其在安全工程中的角色，並從數學與工程角度解釋為何它如此關鍵卻也難以使用。以下是內容的中文解釋與整理：

### 1. **密碼學與安全工程的交匯點**
密碼學是現代安全協議的基礎工具，用來保護分散式系統。但設計正確的密碼系統並不容易。許多錯誤的使用方式會削弱其有效性。

### 2. **學習密碼學的重要性**
密碼學是安全工程師無法忽視的領域。文中以一個醫學的例子強調基礎知識的重要性：  
一位醫生因無法理解一個病人沒有腎臟就無法產生尿液，而未能進行必要的手術。類似地，安全工程師也必須理解基礎原理，否則可能會錯用密碼工具。

### 3. **三個層次的密碼學學習**
- **直覺基礎 (Intuitions)**：了解密碼學概念的直觀理解。  
- **數學 (Mathematics)**：用來證明安全性並整理複雜構造的工具。  
- **密碼工程 (Cryptographic Engineering)**：常見工具的使用與可能出現的錯誤。

這段文字強調，無論你是否受過數學訓練，了解這些基礎都很重要，尤其是常見的加密工具可能預設不安全。例如，微軟的 CAPI 會默認使用電子代碼簿模式 (ECB mode)，一種被認為不安全的加密模式。

### 4. **密碼學基本術語**
- **密碼學 (Cryptography)**：設計密碼系統的科學和藝術。  
- **密碼分析學 (Cryptanalysis)**：破解密碼系統的科學和藝術。  
- **密碼學總稱 (Cryptology)**：涵蓋密碼學和密碼分析學。  

密碼學的輸入叫做**明文 (plaintext)**，輸出則叫**密文 (ciphertext)**。

### 5. **基本構造**
- **區塊加密 (Block Cipher)**：分為兩類：
  - **對稱密鑰加密 (Symmetric)**：使用相同的密鑰加密和解密。
  - **非對稱密鑰加密 (Asymmetric)**：加密和解密使用不同的密鑰。  
- **數位簽章 (Digital Signature)**：一種特殊的非對稱加密技術。

### 6. **進一步學習**
該章節將介紹密碼學歷史、現代安全模型（如完美保密性和隨機預言機模型），並解析重要的加密演算法如何運作和被用來保護資料。

### 總結
這段文字以工程師為目標，結合理論與實例來教導基礎密碼學概念，幫助理解常見工具中的問題和正確用法。
